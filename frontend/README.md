# FaceCheck
This application accepts the URL of any image online, dynamically fetches it and highlights all the faces in it.

While this is complete in its current state as a means of identifying the presence of humans in pictures, 
(useful for automated surveillance feeds among many applications), we intend to make it smarter in future,
especially as technology evolves, hopefully leveraging this into a robust, high-accuracy system for 
password-free user ID and authentication.
