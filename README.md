# FaceCheck
This application accepts the URL of any image online, dynamically fetches it and identifies all humans in it 
by detecting and highlighting all the faces found. This is useful for image sorting/moderation, automated surveillance feeds - among other applications.

Todo: Further clean up the code, and make the application smarter over time, hopefully eventually making 
this part of a robust, high-accuracy system for password-free ID and authentication.

Needs a clarifai API key in server.js to work
