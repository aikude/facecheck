# FaceCheck
This application accepts the URL of any image online, dynamically fetches it and identifies all humans in it 
by detecting and highlighting all the faces found.

While usable in its current state, (e.g. for automated surveillance feeds - among many applications), 
we intend to make it smarter over time, and leverage this into a robust, high-accuracy system for 
password-free ID and authentication.
